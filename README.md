The app I developed aims to address users' needs for managing inventory, events, or weight and sending SMS notifications. The goal was to create an intuitive and user-friendly experience that allows users to easily create, update, and delete items in their database, as well as log in or create a new account if necessary. The SMS notification feature was designed to be optional and only accessible if users grant permission.

To support these needs, the app includes different screens and features. There's a login screen where users can enter their credentials or create a new account. Once logged in, users are taken to the main screen where they can manage their database, adding new items, editing or deleting existing ones, and viewing all the items as a grid. The app also includes a permission request feature, where users can choose to grant or deny access to sending SMS notifications.

To create a user-centered UI, I focused on making the app easy to navigate with clear labeling and feedback messages to keep users informed of what's happening in the app. I also made sure the database management features were intuitive and straightforward, allowing users to accomplish tasks with minimal effort.

In terms of coding, I employed best practices such as in-line comments and appropriate naming conventions to enhance code readability. I used different techniques to implement database queries, permission requests, and SMS messaging functionality, ensuring that the app had proper error handling and was robust enough to handle different scenarios.

Testing was a critical part of the process, and I used the Android Emulator to test the app frequently. This helped me catch bugs and ensure the app was functional and performed as expected, particularly regarding database updates, permission requests, and SMS messaging functionality.

One of the most challenging aspects of the development process was creating a persistent database that would store user information even when the app was closed. To overcome this challenge, I researched SQLite databases and implemented appropriate queries to create a functional database shell that met the app's requirements.

Overall, the app's design and development process aimed to provide users with an enjoyable experience that met their needs. Through innovation and testing, I was able to deliver a functional app that allowed users to manage their inventory, events, or weight with ease while optionally receiving SMS notifications when needed.
